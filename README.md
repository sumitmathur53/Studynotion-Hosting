# StudyNotion(AN ED-TECH PLATFORM)

## **Project Description**

StudyNotion is a fully functional ed-tech platform that enables users to create, consume,
and rate educational content. The platform is built using the MERN stack, which includes
ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, and ExpressJS.
StudyNotion aims to provide:

 - A seamless and interactive learning experience for students, making education
more accessible and engaging.
 - A platform for instructors to showcase their expertise and connect with learners
across the globe.

In summary, StudyNotion is a versatile and intuitive ed-tech platform that is designed to
provide an immersive learning experience to students and a platform for instructors to
showcase their expertise. In the following sections, we will delve into the technical details
of the platform, which will provide a comprehensive understanding of the platform's
features and functionalities.

## **System Architecture**
The StudyNotion ed-tech platform consists of three main components: the front end, the
back end, and the database. The platform follows a client-server architecture, with the
front end serving as the client and the back end and database serving as the server.
**Front-end**
The front end of the platform is built using ReactJS, which is a popular JavaScript library
for building user interfaces. ReactJS allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive user
interfaces, which are critical for providing an engaging learning experience to the students.
The front end communicates with the back end using RESTful API calls.
**Back-end**
The back end of the platform is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS, which are popular
frameworks for building scalable and robust server-side applications. The back end
provides APIs for the front end to consume, which include functionalities such as user
authentication, course creation, and course consumption. The back end also handles the
logic for processing and storing the course content and user data.
**Database**
The database for the platform is built using MongoDB, which is a NoSQL database that
provides a flexible and scalable data storage solution. MongoDB allows for the storage of
unstructured and semi-structured data, which is useful for storing course content such as
videos, images, and PDFs. The database stores the course content, user data, and other
relevant information related to the platform.
